    <h3>Educational background</h3>
    <p>
        I am a final-year student, completing my National Diploma in Information 
        Technology (Software Development) at Tshwane University of Technology. 
        I hope to graduate with the average of over 70% later this year. 
        One of the requirements for completion of the diploma is that I 
        undergo six months experiential learning in the workplace.

    <h3>Previous project</h3>
    <p>
        While I was still at school, I worked on a system called grad 
        work. This was a most valuable experience for me as I did 
        Unified Modeling Language, Web development and database design 
        and implementation. The system was to help graduates find jobs 
        based on their qualification. This gave me the opportunity to 
        enhance my programming skills and learn more. One of my special 
        interests in the field is coding and data-base design
